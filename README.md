# Stochastic-simulations-project
TODO list:
- on Thursday ask to the TA the questions:
                  the square in eq (11)
                  what do they mean with "generalize the estimator"
                  point 5.a "solve the problem" how? numerically? for multiple values of a and b?
                  point 5.b, use the MCLS or the weighted one?
- 1: Francesca ------------------ OK
- 2.a: Sophie ------------------- OK
- 2.b: Marianna --- currently, problems to think about
- 3: Sophie ----- done, to be checked
- 4: 2 methods to implement + estimators
   * 4a) Sophie -- implemented, low acc rate, to be checked
   * 4b) 
   * 4c)
- 5:
   * 5a) done both with Euler scheme and solve_ivp function
   * 5b)
   * 5c)
