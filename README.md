# Stochastic-simulations-project
TODO list:
- on Thursday ask to the TA the questions:
                  the square in eq (11)
                  what do they mean with "generalize the estimator"
                  point 3.a "solve the problem" how? numerically? for multiple values of a and b
- 1: Francesca
- 2.a: Sophie
- 2.b: Marianna
- everybody think about a bound for the point 4
