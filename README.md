# Stochastic-simulations-project
TODO list:
- on Thursday ask to the TA the questions:
                  the square in eq (11)
                  what do they mean with "generalize the estimator"
                  point 5.a "solve the problem" how? numerically? for multiple values of a and b?
                  point 5.b, use the MCLS or the weighted one?
- 1: Francesca ------------------ OK
- 2.a: Sophie ------------------- OK
- 2.b: Marianna --- currently
- 3: Sophie ----- done but to be checked
