## Variance reduction in Monte Carlo integration via function approximation

### Francesca Bettinelli, Marianna Dell'Otto, Sophie Lequeu

The goal of this project is to reduce the variance of the Crude Monte Carlo estimator for the integral of a function $f$ by using the least squares approximation of $f$ as a multiple control variate. First, we present two basic variants of the Monte Carlo Least Squares estimator (MCLS and MCLS') and compare them with CMC on a simple one-dimensional integral. Then, to overcome some limitations of these estimators, we propose an alternative version based on importance sampling. These reduced-variance estimators are then applied to a more interesting case, the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model. In particular, we implement two-dimensional versions of the estimators to evaluate an integral of interest. Finally, we propose an error estimator, strongly related to the quality of the least squares approximation.
